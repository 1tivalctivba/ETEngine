# Soil Mechanics by Lambe and Whitman: A Classic Textbook on the Physics of Soil
 
Soil mechanics is the branch of engineering that deals with the behavior of soil under different environmental conditions, such as loading, drainage, temperature, and stress. Soil mechanics is essential for designing and constructing foundations, retaining walls, slopes, dams, tunnels, pavements, and other structures that interact with soil.

One of the most comprehensive and authoritative textbooks on soil mechanics is *Soil Mechanics* by T. William Lambe and Robert V. Whitman. First published in 1960, this book has been revised and updated several times to reflect the latest developments and research in the field. The latest edition was published in 1991 by John Wiley & Sons.
 
*Soil Mechanics* covers the fundamental concepts and principles of soil mechanics, such as stress, strain, shear, permeability, consolidation, strength, and deformation. It also provides detailed explanations and examples of various soil problems and solutions, such as earth retaining structures, earth slopes, shallow and deep foundations, pore pressures, fluid flow, and soil improvement. The book is organized into four parts: introduction, dry soil, soil with water-steady flow, and soil with water-transient flow.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous figures, tables, and charts to illustrate the concepts and methods. The book also includes appendices on symbols, conversion factors, references, and an index. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of civil engineering, as well as practicing engineers and researchers who want to deepen their knowledge and skills in soil mechanics.
 
*Soil Mechanics* by Lambe and Whitman is available in both print and digital formats. The print version can be purchased from various online retailers or bookstores. The digital version can be accessed as a PDF file from various websites or online libraries. One example of such a website is [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/soilmechanics00lamb), where the 1969 edition of the book can be downloaded for free.
 
One of the topics covered in *Soil Mechanics* by Lambe and Whitman is the stress-strain relations for undrained conditions. This topic is discussed in chapter 14 of the book, starting from page 455. The authors explain how to derive the stress-strain relations for undrained triaxial compression tests on saturated clay samples. They also show how to use these relations to analyze the stability of earth structures under undrained conditions.
 
In summary, *Soil Mechanics* by Lambe and Whitman is a classic textbook on the physics of soil that provides comprehensive and in-depth information on the behavior of soil under wet, dry, or transiently wet conditions. It is a valuable resource for students, engineers, and researchers who want to learn more about soil mechanics and its applications.
